## Introduction

Agriculture is a vital sector that requires accurate methods for predicting crop yields. Sadia's Crop-Forecast ML Pro aims to revolutionize the agriculture industry by providing precise predictions based on historical data and real-time inputs. This tool helps mitigate risks associated with farming and improves food security by making the agricultural sector more resilient and sustainable.

## Features

- **Predict Crop Yields**: Utilize advanced machine learning algorithms to predict crop yields accurately.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive interface for inputting data and viewing predictions.
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Leverage AI to support agricultural productivity.
- **No API Key Required**: Seamless access without needing an API key.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sadiasakharkar/CropForecastML.git
   cd AgriYield-Pro

2. **Install dependencies:**
    bash
   
       pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Ensure model file:
    Place the trained model file dtr (1).pkl in the project directory.


## Usage 

   Start the application by running:
   
    ```bash
       streamlit run web_app.py

   Input Features
    Year: Year for which crop yield prediction is required.
    Average Rainfall (mm per year): Annual average rainfall in millimeters.
    Pesticides (tonnes): Quantity of pesticides used in tonnes.
    Average Temperature (Â°C): Average temperature in degrees Celsius.
    Area: Select the geographic area from the provided options.
    Item: Choose the type of crop from the available options.

   Example
   After launching the Streamlit app, input the required features and click "Predict" to view the    predicted    crop yield.



## Model Details
The prediction model used is a Decision Tree Regressor trained on historical crop yield data. The dtr (1).pkl file contains the model parameters and is loaded during runtime to predict crop yields based on user inputs.
